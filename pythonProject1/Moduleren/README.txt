Usage
To use this project you need to use commandline first
an example is: python3 module.py ./Datasets/top50ffc.csv boxplot
you can also use barchart instead of boxplot
you can also use other .csv data giles instead of the ./Datasets/top50ffx.csv by replacing it with the wanted path
there might be further input moments in the terminal depending on input, such as what parts of the dataset to use and if its horizontal or vertical
