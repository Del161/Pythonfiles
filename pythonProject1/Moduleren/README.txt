Name
Modulation plotting test


Description
This project can create bargraphs or boxplots with a variety of different settings.
Only files with numerical data values work


Installation
You can get this project by going to the github page: https://github.com/Del161/Pythonfiles
When hitting fork in the top right of the page you get a copy of the repository you can work with.


Usage
To use this project you need to use commandline first
an example is: python3 module.py ./Datasets/top50ffc.csv boxplot
you can also use barchart instead of boxplot
you can also use other .csv data giles instead of the ./Datasets/top50ffx.csv by replacing it with the wanted path
there might be further input moments in the terminal depending on input, such as what parts of the dataset to use and if its horizontal or vertical

ps (not recommended to use this with too large datasets, the names will overlap, and it might become unreadable)
